# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying

This repository demonstrates a common issue where Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply correctly.  The primary problem is with hover effects not working as expected. The bug is reproduced by trying to apply bg-red-500 and hover:bg-blue-700 to a div element.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains the incorrect implementation which fails to render the Tailwind CSS classes correctly.  The hover effect is not working either.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file presents the solution.  This involves double checking the Tailwind configuration and build process to ensure that the classes are correctly compiled and included in the final CSS output.  Additionally, it demonstrates the correct way to use hover classes.
